I am currently a second-year master student in the College of Computer Science, Nankai University, under the supervision of Professor [ Ming-Ming Cheng](https://mmcheng.net/cmm/).<br>
I received my Bachelor degree in Beijing University of Chemical Technology, China. 

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in **Efficient Deep Learning**, but also include neural architecture search, network pruning and network quantization. <br>
Indeed, my works focus on **generalization** analysis of those areas and building efficient  **frameworks** for various computer vision tasks.
